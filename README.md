# Task-Management-System
This Python program simulates a task management system where users are able to register a new user, add a task, view all tasks, view admin-specific tasks, generate reports on all tasks & users, and display statistics on tasks.

## Install
- No external dependencies needed, but ensure that you have the relevant .txt files located in the same directory as the .py file to ensure proper functionaltiy.

## Usage
First, ensure that all `.txt` files are in the same directory as the `.py` file. Then, run:
```
$ python task_manager.py
```
Login credentials can be found in the `user.txt` file, as coded in the `# Login Section` in the program. For quick & easy testing, using the following credentials:
```
Username: admin
Password: adm1n
```
As an admin user, you are then presented with a menu that allows you to perform functions as mentioned above.
